    "# Assignment 4: Instruction finetuning a Llama-2 7B model - part 1\n",
    "**Assignment due 19 April 11:59pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth assignment for 50.055 Machine Learning Operations. These assignments give you a chance to practice the methods and tools you have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is a group assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions in this notebook carefully\n",
    "- Add your solution code and answers in the appropriate places. The questions are marked as **QUESTION:**, the places where you need to add your code and text answers are marked as **ADD YOUR SOLUTION HERE**\n",
    "- The completed notebook, including your added code and generated output will be your submission for the assignment.\n",
    "- The notebook should execute without errors from start to finish when you select \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..\". Please test this before submission.\n",
    "- Use the SUTD Education Cluster to solve and test the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubric for assessment** \n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded using the following criteria. \n",
    "1. Code executes: your code should execute without errors. The SUTD Education cluster should be used to ensure the same execution environment.\n",
    "2. Correctness: the code should produce the correct result or the text answer should state the factual correct answer.\n",
    "3. Style: your code should be written in a way that is clean and efficient. Your text answers should be relevant, concise and easy to understand.\n",
    "4. Partial marks will be awarded for partially correct solutions.\n",
    "5. There is a maximum of 200 (80 + 40 + 80) points for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT policy** \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to solve the assignment questions, you need to be transparent about its use and mark AI-generated content as such. In particular, you should include the following in addition to your final answer:\n",
    "- A copy or screenshot of the prompt you used\n",
    "- The name of the AI model\n",
    "- The AI generated output\n",
    "- An explanation why the answer is correct or what you had to change to arrive at the correct answer\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of the assignment is to build a chatbot that can talk to prospective students and answer questions about SUTD, similar to the chat-with-a-student function on the SUTD website (https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/chat)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a RAG approach, in this assignment, you will finetune an LLM to perform the task. We will fine-tune a LLama-2 7B LLM model on question-answer pairs which we synthetically generate with an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will  be leveraging `langchain`, `llama 2`, and `LoRA` again.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: generate training data\n",
    "The first step of the assignment is generating synthetic question-answer pairs which can be used for finetuning an LLM model. \n",
    "To do this, we first load an LLM and the RAG question-answering system about SUTD from assignment 3. Ideally we would use a very accurate LLM, like GPT-4, to generate the\n",
    "the training data. For cost reasons, here we will use Llama-2 13B.\n",
