    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6a & 6b vs Original\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- The improved models perform much better in terms of accuracy as they are able to give answers specific to SUTD, while the original model gave more generic answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    E.g for the question on research opportunities in SUTD,\n",
    "\n",
    "    original model answer : 'SUTD supports student research opportunities and industry partnerships through its research centers and labs, as well as its partnerships with industry leaders. These partnerships provide students with access to cutting-edge research and industry-relevant projects, enhancing their education and career prospects. Additionally, SUTD's research centers and labs offer students the opportunity to work on real-world projects and collaborate with industry partners, further enhancing their research experience.' \n",
    "\n",
    "    Improved model answer: 'SUTD supports student research opportunities through its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which allows students to work on research projects with faculty members. 2) SUTD has established partnerships with industry partners such as A*STAR, Samsung, and Microsoft to provide students with research opportunities and internships. 3) SUTD has a dedicated Office of Research and Innovation (ORI) that supports faculty research and industry partnerships.'SUTD supports student research opportunities through its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which allows students to work on research projects with faculty members. 2) SUTD has established partnerships with industry partners such as A*STAR, Samsung, and Microsoft to provide students with research opportunities and internships. 3) SUTD has a dedicated Office of Research and Innovation (ORI) that supports faculty research and industry partnerships.'  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The improved model is able to reference SUTD specific things like UROP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the above example we can also see that the improved model is also prone to hallucinating, because there's no Office of research and innovation in SUTD. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another con is also that the improved model responses are prone to data leakage. This could be due to the fact that since it is finetuned on only 200 questions, the model has memorised the questions. This causes the fluency score to be much lesser for the improved models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6a vs 6b\n",
    "\n",
    "- Between the improved models, the one that performed better was the 6b model (trained on sonnet and mistral outputs). Its answers were able to be more focused towards SUTD. \n",
    "\n",
    "    E.g for the question on career services, \n",
    "\n",
    "    6a model answer : '1) SUTD provides career services and job placements through its Career Centre, which helps students with career planning, job search, and networking opportunities. 2) The Career Centre organizes career fairs, workshops, and industry talks to connect students with potential employers. 3) SUTD has a strong alumni network, with over 10,000 alumni working in various industries around the world. 4) The Career Centre works closely with alumni to provide internship and job opportunities for students. 5) SUTD has a dedicated team that helps students with job applications, resume writing, and interview preparation. 6) The Career Centre also provides resources like career guides, industry reports, and online job portals to help' \n",

The CDC provides resources and guidance to students on career planning, job search strategies, and networking opportunities. It also organizes career fairs and workshops to help students connect with potential employers. Additionally, SUTD has established partnerships with over 30 industry partners, which can provide students with internship and employment opportunities. The university also offers a Capstone project, which allows students to apply their knowledge and skills in real-world settings, potentially leading to job offers.' \n",
    "\n",
    "    The 6b answer is better as it was more detailed because it references CDC and Capstone, which suits the context of SUTD more than the 6a model, whose answer was more generic. \n",
